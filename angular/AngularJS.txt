*********** DEFINICIONES, CONCEPTOS *************************************************************************************

-> Del sitio oficial.... https://angularjs.org/

	* Why AngularJS?
		HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. 
		AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. 
		The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
	* Alternatives	
		Other frameworks deal with HTML’s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. 
		Neither of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.
	* Extensibility
		AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. 
		It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs.	
	
	*** Add some control ***	
		* Data Binding 	https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding
			Data-binding is an automatic way of updating the view whenever the model changes, as well as updating the model whenever the view changes. 
			This is awesome because it eliminates DOM manipulation from the list of things you have to worry about	
		* Controller 
			Controllers are the behavior behind the DOM elements.
			AngularJS lets you express the behavior in a clean readable form without the usual boilerplate of updating the DOM, registering callbacks or watching model changes	
		* Plain JavaScript 
			Unlike other frameworks, there is no need to inherit from proprietary types in order to wrap the model in accessors methods. 
			Angular models are plain old JavaScript objects. This makes your code easy to test, maintain, reuse, and again free from boilerplate.
	
	*** Wire up a Backend ***
		* Deep Linking 
			A deep link reflects where the user is in the app, this is useful so users can bookmark and email links to locations within apps. 
			Round trip apps get this automatically, but AJAX apps by their nature do not. AngularJS combines the benefits of deep link with desktop app-like behavior.
		* Form Validation
			Client-side form validation is an important part of great user experience. AngularJS lets you declare the validation rules of the form without having to write JavaScript code. Write less code, go have beer sooner.
		* Server Communication
			AngularJS provides built-in services on top of XHR as well as various other backends using third party libraries. Promises further simplify your code by handling asynchronous return of data. 
			
	*** Create Components ***
		* Directives
			Directives is a unique and powerful feature available only in Angular. Directives let you invent new HTML syntax, specific to your application.
		* Reusable Components
			We use directives to create reusable components. A component allows you to hide complex DOM structure, CSS, and behavior. This lets you focus either on what the application does or how the application looks separately.
		* Localization
			An important part of serious apps is localization. Angular's locale aware filters and stemming directives give you building blocks to make your application available in all locales.
		
	*** Embed and Inject ***
		* Embeddable
			AngularJS works great with other technologies. Add as much or as little of AngularJS to an existing page as you like. Many other frameworks require full commitment.
			Because AngularJS has no global state multiple apps can run on a single page without the use of iframes.
		* Injectable
			The dependency injection in AngularJS allows you to declaratively describe how your application is wired. This means that your application needs no main() method which is usually an unmaintainable mess. 
			Dependency injection is also a core to AngularJS. This means that any component which does not fit your needs can easily be replaced.
		* Testable
			AngularJS was designed from ground up to be testable. It encourages behavior-view separation, comes pre-bundled with mocks, and takes full advantage of dependency injection. 
			It also comes with end-to-end scenario runner which eliminates test flakiness by understanding the inner workings of AngularJS.
	
-> Del repo.... https://github.com/angular/angular.js

	"AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. 
	It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. 
	It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding.
	To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control.

	Oh yeah and it helps with server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and deferreds. 
	It also makes client-side navigation and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake.
	The best of all: it makes development fun!"

-> De wikipedia....	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS

	"AngularJS, commonly referred to as Angular, is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. 
	Its goal is to simplify both development and testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, along with components commonly used in rich internet applications.

	The library works by first reading the HTML page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag attributes. 
	Those attributes are interpreted as directives telling Angular to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. 
	The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.	"
	
	* Two-way data binding
		AngularJS' two-way data binding is its most notable feature, and it reduces the amount of code written by relieving the server backend of templating responsibilities. 
		Instead, templates are rendered in plain HTML according to data contained in a scope defined in the model. 
		The $scope service in Angular detects changes to the model section and modifies HTML expressions in the view via a controller. 
		Likewise, any alterations to the view are reflected in the model. This circumvents the need to actively manipulate the DOM and encourages bootstrapping and rapid prototyping of web applications.
		AngularJS detects changes in models by comparing the current values with values stored earlier in a process of dirty-checking, unlike Ember.js and Backbone.js which trigger listeners when the model values are changed.
		
	* Comparisons to Backbone.js  <=============================================
		- Data-binding
			The most prominent feature that separates the two libraries is in the way models and views are synchronized. 
			Whereas AngularJS supports two way data-binding, Backbone.js relies heavily on boilerplate code to harmonize its models and views.
		- REST
			Backbone.js communicates well with RESTful backends. A very simple use of REST APIs is also available with AngularJS using the $resource service. 
			AngularJS also provides a $http service which is more flexible, connecting to remote servers either through a browser's XMLHttpRequest object or via JSONP.
		- Templating
			AngularJS templating uses a combination of customizable HTML tags and expressions. Backbone.js ships with underscore.js's utility function template() and also integrates with different templating engines such as Mustache.

	** ¿Qué es Angular?	https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction		<=== VER
		AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. 
		ngular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. 
		And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.
		Angular attempts to minimize the impedance mismatch between document centric HTML and what an application needs by creating new HTML constructs. Angular teaches the browser new syntax through a construct we call directives. 
	
	** A complete client-side solution
		Angular is not a single piece in the overall puzzle of building the client-side of a web application. It handles all of the DOM and AJAX glue code you once wrote by hand and puts it in a well-defined structure. 
		This makes Angular opinionated about how a CRUD application should be built. But while it is opinionated, it also tries to make sure that its opinion is just a starting point you can easily change. 
		Angular comes with the following out-of-the-box:
			- Everything you need to build a CRUD app in a cohesive set: data-binding, basic templating directives, form validation, routing, deep-linking, reusable components, dependency injection.
			- Testability story: unit-testing, end-to-end testing, mocks, test harnesses.
			- Seed application with directory layout and test scripts as a starting point.
	
	** Para qué tipo de aplicaciones no es conveniente Angular:
		Angular fue construido pensando en aplicaciones CRUD (que representan la mayoría de las web app).
		Angular simplifies application development by presenting a higher level of abstraction to the developer. Like any abstraction, it comes at a cost of flexibility. 
		Games and GUI editors are examples of applications with intensive and tricky DOM manipulation. These kinds of apps are different from CRUD apps, and as a result are probably not a good fit for Angular. 
		In these cases it may be better to use a library with a lower level of abstraction, such as jQuery.
	
	** Las ideas de Angular	https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction#the-zen-of-angular
		- declarative code is better than imperative when it comes to building UIs and wiring software components together, while imperative code is excellent for expressing business logic
		- decouple DOM manipulation from app logic (ayuda para testing)
		- regard app testing as equal in importance to app writing. Testing difficulty is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.
		- decouple the client side of an app from the server side. This allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides
		- very helpful indeed if the framework guides developers through the entire journey of building an app: from designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.
		- make common tasks trivial and difficult tasks possible.
		- Angular libera al desarrollador de las siguientes tareas engorrosas:
			* Registering callbacks: 
				Removing common boilerplate code such as callbacks is a good thing. It vastly reduces the amount of JavaScript coding you have to do, and it makes it easier to see what your application does.
			* Manipulating HTML DOM programmatically: 
				By declaratively describing how the UI should change as your application state changes, you are freed from low-level DOM manipulation tasks. Most applications written with Angular never have to programmatically manipulate the DOM, although you can if you want to.
			* Marshaling data to and from the UI: 
				The flow of marshaling data from the server to an internal object to an HTML form, allowing users to modify the form, validating the form, displaying validation errors, returning to an internal model, and then back to the server, creates a lot of boilerplate code.
				Angular eliminates almost all of this boilerplate, leaving code that describes the overall flow of the application rather than all of the implementation details.
			* Writing tons of initialization code just to get started: 
				With Angular you can bootstrap your app easily using services, which are auto-injected into your application in a Guice-like dependency-injection style

http://mean-workshop.herokuapp.com/resources/day4/presentation/#/

> TEMPLATES - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/templates
	HTML with additional markup (Angular-specific elements and attributes)
	Angular combines the template with information from the model and controller to render the dynamic view that a user sees in the browser.	
	
Kinds of new markup...
	> DIRECTIVES - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive
		extend HTML with custom attributes and elements
		At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, or CSS class) 
		that tell AngularJS’s HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element or even transform the DOM element and its children.
		- Ejemplos: ng-app, ng-model, ng-controller, ng-repeat, ...
		- Agregan: Comportamiento, Data binding scope, reemplazan o extienden el elemento HTML
		- Execution flow:
			1. Detect the directive (por ej ng-model)
			2. Call the $compile method on the directive
			3. Bind directive with $scope
			4. Render the generated DOM
		-> Custom directives to access the DOM: In Angular, the only place where an application should access the DOM is within directives. 
			If you need to access the DOM directly you should write a custom directive for this
		
	> {{ expression | filter }}    
		Angular uses HTML markups as templates. Dynamic values are represented with {{ variable }}
		When the compiler encounters this markup, it will replace it with the evaluated value of the markup
		> EXPRESSIONS - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression
			access variables and functions from the scope
		> FILTER - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/filter
			formats the value of an expression for display to the user 
			
	> FORMS - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/forms
		Controls (input, select, textarea) are ways for a user to enter data. A Form is a collection of controls for the purpose of grouping related controls together.
		
> COMPILER - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/compiler
	parses the template and instantiates directives and expressions
	
> VIEW
	what the user sees (the rendered DOM)	
	is a projection of the model through the HTML template

> MODEL 
	the data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts - values that are stored in variables on the scope	

> SCOPE - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope
	- context where the model is stored so that controllers, directives and expressions can access it
	- scope is an object that refers to the application model. It is an execution context for expressions 
	- exposes model to templates -> In HTML, values inside {{ variable }} get resolved at runtime from $scope
	- A scope can be seen as the glue which allows the template, model and controller to work together.
	  Angular uses scopes, along with the information contained in the template, data model, and controller, to keep models and views separate, but in sync

	- Si en un controller defino una funcion o variable..
		myApp.controller("MyCtrl", function($scope) {
			$scope.miVariable = 123;
			$scope.otraVar = [{...},{...}]
			$scope.miFuncion = function(..) { 
				var otraVar = $scope.otraVar;
				...
			}
		}
	  Después en HTML puedo usarla en una directiva en un elemento dentro del que tenga ng-controller
		<a href="javascript:" data-ng-click="miFuncion(miVariable)">..</a>;

	"Controller as name"  o "injectar $scope"	
	
> DATA BINDING - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding
	sync data between the model and the view - the DOM will be automatically updated whenever the model changes (variables or result of functions)

> CONTROLLER - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/controller 
	the business logic behind views - The purpose of controllers is to expose variables and functionality to expressions and directives.
	a Controller is a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the Angular Scope.
	- When a Controller is attached to the DOM via the ng-controller directive, Angular will instantiate a new Controller object, using the specified Controller's constructor function
	- A new child scope will be available as an injectable parameter to the Controller's constructor function as $scope
	USAR CONTROLLER PARA...
		- Set up the initial state of the $scope object
		- Add behavior to the $scope object.
	NO USAR CONTROLLER PARA...
		- Manipulate DOM —(Controllers should contain ONLY BUSINESS LOGIC):
			* Putting any presentation logic into Controllers significantly affects its testability
			* Angular has databinding for most cases and directives to encapsulate manual DOM manipulation.
		- Format input —(Use angular FORM CONTROLS instead).	
		- Filter output —(Use angular FILTERS instead).
		- Share code or state across controllers —(Use angular SERVICES instead)
		- Manage the life-cycle of other components (for example, to create service instances).
		
> DEPENDENCY INJECTION (DI) - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di
	Creates and wires objects and functions - Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that deals with how components get hold of their dependencies.
	Everything within Angular (directives, filters, controllers, services, ...) is created and wired using dependency injection.
	The Angular injector subsystem is in charge of creating components, resolving their dependencies, and providing them to other components as requested.

> INJECTOR
	dependency injection container

> MODULE - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module
	a container for the different parts of an app including controllers, services, filters, directives which configures the Injector

> SERVICES - https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services
	reusable business logic independent of views - When the application grows it is a good practice to move view independent logic from the controller into a so called "service"
	Angular services are substitutable objects that are wired together using dependency injection (DI).
	You can use services to organize and share code across your app. Angular services are:
		- Lazily instantiated – Angular only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.
		- Singletons – Each component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance generated by the service factory.
	Angular offers several useful services (like $http), but for most applications you'll also want to create your own.
	Like other core Angular identifiers, built-in services always start with $ (e.g. $http).
	--> there are multiple ways to define their factory
	
	Ejemplo de services:	http://mean-workshop.herokuapp.com/resources/day4/presentation/#/78
	
¿Cuándo usar Controllers, Services or Directives?	
	http://kirkbushell.me/when-to-use-directives-controllers-or-services-in-angular/	
	
> ROUTERS:
	http://mean-workshop.herokuapp.com/resources/day4/presentation/#/71
	
> PROVIDERS - RECIPES:	https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers

	The injector uses recipes to create two types of objects: services and special purpose objects
	There are five recipe types that define how to create objects: Value, Factory, Service, Provider and Constant.
	Factory and Service are the most commonly used recipes.
		The only difference between them is that the Service recipe works better for objects of a custom type, while the Factory can produce JavaScript primitives and functions.
	The Provider recipe is the core recipe type and all the other ones are just syntactic sugar on it.
	Provider is the most complex recipe type. You don't need it unless you are building a reusable piece of code that needs global configuration.	
	All special purpose objects except for the Controller are defined via Factory recipes.

***************** ELEMENTOS, FUNCIONES, FUNCIONAMIENTO ************************************************

-> Inicialización:  <html ng-app="modulo">		
	Tells AngularJS to be active in this portion of the page. In this case the entire document
	When Angular starts, it will use the configuration of the module with the name defined by the ng-app directive, including the configuration of all modules that this module depends on.

-> {{ }} are a declarative way of specifying data binding locations in the HTML.		
	
DIRECTIVAS (etiquetas HTML):

	=> ng-app	
		Declares the root element of an AngularJS application, under which directives can be used to declare bindings and define behavior
	
	=> ng-model="data.attr"
		This links the <element> and the model. This means that any changes to the control update the data in your model, and when you change the model it updates the control.
		(establishes a two-way data binding between the view and the scope.)
	
	=> ng-controller="MiControlador"	
		El comportamiento del <elemento> con esa etiqueta será manejado por la clase MiControlador definida en javascript
		(Specifies a JavaScript controller class that evaluates HTML expressions.)
		
	=> ng-view
		We’re marking this <element> as the place we’ll load partial pages or “views”. The surrounding page will stay static while we load changing UI into this section.	
		(The base directive responsible for handling routes that resolve JSON before rendering templates driven by specified controllers.)

	=> ng-include	<div ng-include="'partials/header.html'"></div>
		Incluye pedazos de html
		
	=> ng-click="funcion()"
		Instead of registering event-handlers, you declare which method on the controller to call.
		
	=> ng-repeat="elem in collection"
		Use ng-repeat to unroll a collection. This is one of the most versatile directives in AngularJS.
		Instantiate an element once per item from a collection.
		Repeaters are “for loops”. We define a list in the Angular scope & then iterate the list using a ng-repeat directive & display the data.
		Por ejemplo, usado en un <li>:
			When objects are added to the collection the ng-repeat automatically adds new <li> elements into the DOM. Similarly when the objects are removed from collection then the corresponding <li> element is removed as well. 
			(data-binding: ng-repeat actualiza el DOM cuando se modifica collection)
		
	=> ng-submit="funcion()"
		Intercepts form submission and instead calls funcion(). 
		
	-> ng-class:"{clas: condition1 && condition2}"
		Agrega al elemento la clase class cuando se cumple la condicion
	-> ng-show:"condition1 && condition2"
		Muestra <element> cuando se cumple una condicion. (por ej, las variables condition1 y condition2 son true)
	-> ng-disabled:"condition"
		Disable <element> cuando se cumple una condicion (por ej, la variable condition es true)	
		
VARIABLES JAVASCRIPT (BUILT-IN SERVICES)
	
	=> $scope
		contains your model data (y funciones). It is the glue between the controller and the view. The $scope is just one of the services that can be injected into the controller.
		
	=> $location	-	https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/$location
		You use the $location service to access the browser's location	
		- $location.path('/...')	
			Use the path method to change the application's 'deep-linking' location. 
			Changing the URL will automatically activate the new route, and transition the application to display that view
	
	=> $routeProvider
		responsible for mapping URL paths to partials.
	=> $routeParams
		We use it to access the parameters extracted from the route path definitions.
		
	=> $http	
		a built-in service provided by Angular for accessing a server backend. 
		The $http service is a core Angular service that facilitates communication with the remote HTTP servers via the browser's XMLHttpRequest object or via JSONP.
		
	-> $locale
		The $locale service contains meta-data for the current locale	
	
FUNCIONES		
		
	=> angular.module('modulo', ...)
		This defines the project module. You use modules to configure existing services, and define new services, directives, filters, and so on.

	=> value: angular.module(...).value('name',value ) 
		Define a singleton object that can be injected into controllers and services.
		
	=> service: angular.module(...).service(name, constructor)
		Register a service constructor, which will be invoked with new to create the service instance
		
	=> factory: angular.module(...).factory(name, $getFn) 
		Register a service factory, which will be called to return the service instance. 
		
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14324451/angular-service-vs-angular-factory	

	=> controller:  angular.module(...).controller('MiControlador',constructor )		constructor: [...,..., function() ]  o function()
		registra el controlador 'MiControlador'
		The controller MiControlador is the code behind the view. You can clearly see your application behavior because there is no DOM manipulation or framework specific boilerplate. Just simple, readable JavaScript.
		Si se pasa un arreglo como constructor:
			The array first contains the names of the service dependencies that the controller needs. 
			The last entry in the array is the controller constructor function.
		
	=> config: angular.module(...).config(function($service) { .... })
		You use config() to configure existing services.
		Use this method to register work which needs to be performed on module loading.
		
	=> directive: angular.module(...).('name',function(...){ }	)
		Define new HTML vocabulary for our components	(Register a new directive with the compiler)
